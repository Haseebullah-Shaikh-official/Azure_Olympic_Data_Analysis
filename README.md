# Azure_Olympic_Data_Analysis
The project is fully implemented on the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform, following an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. The extraction process begins by retrieving data from GitHub as an API source. This data is then ingested into Azure Data Lake Gen 2. The transformation step occurs within Azure Databricks, where data engineering processes are applied to refine and structure the information. The resulting transformed data is loaded back into Azure Data Lake Gen 2. This refined dataset is being analyzed using SQL queries facilitated by Synapse Analytics. Furthermore, the processed data can be leveraged to develop interactive dashboards using Power BI for comprehensive visualization and analytics.
